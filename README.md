# React Calculator

Create a React app that mimics a simple calculator

## Overview

- Please use `create-react-app` to generate your project
- Break your application down to necessary components

## UI

Example project: https://www.coreyladovsky.com/calculator/

Feel free to make the design your own.  Here are some real calculator UIs that you can use for inspiration.

## User Stories, Acceptance Criteria, and Code Quality Rubric

You must implement all of the user stories and acceptance criteria below. After those are completed, look at and implement as many of the stretch features as you want to.

### User Stories

1. I can see a calculator UI.
1. I can enter and see positive and negative integers.
1. I can add, subtract, multiply, and divide.
1. I can clear my input to reset everything.
1. I can visit the calculator on the Internet.

### Acceptance Criteria

**I can see a calculator UI.**

- I can see a number keypad on the calculator with the numbers 0-9.
- I can see keys for the plus, subtract, multiple, and divide operators.
- I can see an equals `=` key.
- I can see a `+/-` key.
- I can see an all clear key `AC`.
- I can see a "screen" which shows a default value of 0.

**I can enter readable positive and negative integers.**

- I can click a number key and see the number on the screen.
- I can enter multi-digit numbers on the keypad and see them on the screen.
- When I enter a number of 1,000 or more, I see commas appear in the right place to format the number. (Example: 14,563,024)
- I can make a positive number negative (or vice versa) with the `+/-` key.

**I can add, subtract, multiply, and divide.**

- I can enter a number, `+`, another number, then `=` and see the correct addition result.
- I can enter a number, `-`, another number, then `=` and see the correct subtraction result.
- I can enter a number, `x`, another number, then `=` and see the correct multiplication result.
- I can enter a number, `x`, another number, then `=` and see the correct division result _rounded to the nearest integer_.

**I can clear my input to reset everything.**

- When I click the clear key, the number on the screen is removed.
- When I click the clear key, I see a default number `0` on the screen.
- When I click the clear key during a calculation in progress, the full state is reset. (When I push `=`, the screen should still say `0`)

**I can visit the calculator on the Internet.**

- A working public URL is submitted that loads the project.

### Code Quality Rubric

- Use JSX to create components
- Use create-react-app to build React applications
- Respond to user input to update the views in a React app
- Use state to build stateful React applications
- Use Flexbox and/or Grid to lay out a page

### Stretch Features

- `.` button that adds a decimal point to the current number
- `%` button that converts the current value into a percentage
- Support exponentiation and square roots
- Support geometric operations (`sin`, `cos`, `tan`, etc.)

### Stretchier Stretch Features
- Write Cypress tests for your calculator!
- Support large and small numbers with [scientific notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_notation#E_notation)
- Change the clear button to toggle between:
    - AC Clears all of the data in the screen and all the history
    - C: Clears only what is being displayed
- Chain together multiple operands
    - ex:  5 + 5 + 5

### Super-Stretch Features
- Chain together multiple equals sign button pushes
    - ex: `5` `+` `5` `=` `=` `=` should display `20`
- `()` buttons to support order of operations
- Implement [Dijkstra's famous two-stack algorithm](https://youtu.be/0sixdU-cehs?t=395) to calculate expressions with `()`


Helpful Libraries for Decimals:
- [decimal.js](https://mikemcl.github.io/decimal.js/)
- [math.js](https://mathjs.org/)


## State

State will be an important component of your application.  It may be helpful to think about incorporating the following elements into your state:

- displayValue (What the screen currently displays)
- previousValue (What value the user selected before pressing an operation button)
- operation (What operation the user is performing (+/-/÷/x))

## Deploy 
Deploy your app following these [instructions](https://github.com/joinpursuit/Pursuit-Core-Web/tree/master/react/react_deployment)
